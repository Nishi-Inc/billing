# Billing
A tool to generate bills for personal use.
## Contributing
1. It is published at http://billing.nishionline.com.
2. Put all the external js and css files used in `libs` so that it can be distributed as a stand-alone app.
3. DO NOT FORGET to set the `devMode` variable in `main.js` to `false` before committing your deeds.
4. This bill generator uses [pdfmake](https://github.com/bpampuch/pdfmake). Thanks to the developers.
