A tool to generate bills for personal use. Useful for small retail shops/ grocery stores etc.

## Contributing
1. It is published at http://billing.nishionline.com and will always be published here, but it WILL NOT receive any updates any more. New more secure billing software is live at https://billing.clay.fish.
2. Put all the external js and css files used in `libs` so that it can be distributed as a stand-alone app.
3. `devMode` variable in `/js/main.js` is set to be `true` on `localhost`. If you are using some other host, please modify it accordingly.
4. This bill generator uses [pdfMake](https://github.com/bpampuch/pdfmake). Thanks to the developers.

This repo won't receive any new commits, for new stuff see [clayfish/billing](https://github.com/clayfish/billing).
